### Issue

Project tracking is done via GitHub [issues](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/blobstream-sn/issues).
First look at open issues to see if your request is already submitted. If it is comment on the issue requesting assignment,
if not open an issue.

We use 3 issue [labels](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/blobstream-sn/issues/new):

> `feat:`, `bug:`, `dev:`

Your branch must be prefixed in the following issue map (`type`, `title:`, `branch-prefix/`):

- `Feature request` -> `feat:` -> `feat/{issue #}-{issue name}`
- `Bug report` -> `bug:` -> `bug/{issue #}-{issue name}`
- `Codebase improvement` -> `dev:` -> `dev/{issue #}-{issue name}`

#### Bug Reports
Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.
